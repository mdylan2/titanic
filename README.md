# Predicting Survival on the Titanic using Machine Learning
## Description
This repository contains a notebook to predict survival on the titanic for the famous competition on Kaggle. The primary purpose of this project was to improve my knowledge of data visualization techniques, feature engineering, and basic machine learning classification algorithms.

The original Kaggle submission can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/dylanmendonca/predicting-survival-on-titanic-plotly).
